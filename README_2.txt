## 1. Project Planning & Requirements Gathering
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Define specific climate-related problems in Nepal to address (e.g., glacial melt, flooding, agricultural impacts)
Research existing climate monitoring infrastructure in Nepal
Identify key stakeholders (government agencies, NGOs, research institutions)
Determine required resources (computing, storage, expertise)
_______________________________________________________________________________________
Objective
Identify and define a specific climate-related issue in Nepal that the capstone project will focus on, and establish the foundational requirements for successful implementation.

Problem Definition
Clearly define the climate-related problem(s) the project aims to address. Possible focus areas include:
- Glacial melt and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs)
- Monsoon-related flooding and landslides
- Agricultural impacts due to shifting rainfall and temperature patterns
- Drought risk and water resource management
- Urban heat islands and air quality degradation

Research Existing Infrastructure
Understand Nepal’s current climate monitoring capabilities:
- Weather stations (DHM – Department of Hydrology and Meteorology)
- Satellite imagery sources (NASA, ESA, SERVIR Himalaya)
- Historical climate datasets (ERA5, WorldClim, etc.)
- Community-based monitoring programs

Identify Stakeholders
List and describe key stakeholders who are involved in or impacted by climate data and decision-making:
- Government: DHM, Ministry of Forests and Environment, local municipalities
- NGOs & INGOs: ICIMOD, Practical Action, WWF, UNDP
- Research Institutions: Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu University, NAST
- Local communities: Farmers, indigenous groups, disaster-prone populations

Determine Required Resources
List the tools, data, and expertise needed:
- Computing resources: Laptops/servers with Python, R, or GIS tools installed
- Storage: Capacity to handle satellite and raster data (e.g., 10–50GB+)
- Software/Tools: QGIS, Python libraries (Pandas, Rasterio, Matplotlib), Google Earth Engine
- Human expertise:
    - Climate scientists or advisors
    - Data analysts or GIS specialists
    - Local knowledge holders or field researchers
